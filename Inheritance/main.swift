//inheritance: and OOP princicple when you can define a hierachial relationship
// a base class aka a super class aka super class
// derived class aka sub class aka child class

// a sub class inherits the state and behavior from a super class
// in swift, structs do not support inheritance
// in swift there is no universal base class... i.e. no object class
// use the key work super to refer to a member of the super class
// use the key work overide to refer to a member of the super class
